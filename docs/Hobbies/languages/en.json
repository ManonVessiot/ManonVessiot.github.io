    "hiking_post1_description": "I made the mistake of allowing my mother to organize this trip, which I now regret. Let me clarify, the trip was enjoyable, and the scenery was stunning. However, if I were to get lost, I would prefer it to be in the forest rather than spending more than half of the hike on the road.<br><br>In the end, we managed to walk a considerable distance, shared some laughter, discovered \"Le Gour de Conque,\" and even indulged in a nap under the sun after our picnic. We also encountered four magnificent horses who were eager to play. Overall, it was a successful hike, but not the kind that I would repeat.",
