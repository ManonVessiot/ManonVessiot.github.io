    "bonimenteur_description": "Le Bonimenteur is an application designed by my brother Romain and myself. I first developed it on Unity and made it available on Google Store. But not having the possibility to give access to people using Apple devices, I decided to develop it in web, allowing access to any device with a browser.<br><br>This game is made for 3 players minimum. The principle is to debate on a subject, without giving too many details, because among the players hides one or more liars who do not have the subject. These liars must pretend to know the subject by debating it with others. The goal of liars is not to be unmasked and to find the subject. As for the other players, they must unmask the liars without making them understand what this debate is about.<br><br>Thus, players can discuss more or less serious subjects, such as glue hours. Is it really useful? Are we for or against? ... Go ahead, <a href=\"https://manonvessiot.github.io/lebonimenteurgame/\" target=\"_blank\">try</a>!",

During this event, I developed two virtual reality applications. The first application focused on education, providing an immersive learning experience. The second application was oriented towards simulation and gaming, offering a virtual bowling experience. Allow me to introduce you to this final one.",

    "guesscolor_description2": "Within a room, the user finds themselves surrounded by various objects whose colors remain unknown. The objective is to correctly position each object within the square that corresponds to its actual color. To aid in this task, the user has access to three switches that can alter the color of the room's lighting, enabling them to switch between red, green, and blue lights. As a result, certain objects may exhibit unique appearances based on the <b>additive synthesis principle</b>. For instance, a magenta object will appear black under green light, red under red light, and blue under blue light.<br><br>Here is a demonstration:",
